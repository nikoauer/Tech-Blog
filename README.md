Furthermore make sure you source the schema.sql (located in db folder).

It is optional to seed the seeds folder with the command (node seeds/seed.js) in your integrated terminal, however it is not necessary if you don't want this mock data to be active in the project.

Then npm install in the terminal to make sure you have all the necessary dependancies.

Then run node.server.js if you wish to run the program on your own personal server in order to see it live.
